Portability: Containers are more portable than PaaS, enabling an application to run on any infrastructure that supports the containerization technology.
Flexibility: Containers offer more flexibility by allowing developers to customize the application environment to meet specific needs, unlike PaaS which may have limitations on supported languages and applications.
Resource Efficiency: Containers are lightweight and can run on smaller instances, reducing costs, while PaaS may require more resources than necessary due to the management of underlying infrastructure.
Scalability: Containers are more scalable than PaaS, allowing for easy horizontal scaling and multiple instances of an application to run simultaneously.
Security: Containers are more secure than PaaS, providing an extra layer of security with each container being isolated from the host operating system and other containers.
